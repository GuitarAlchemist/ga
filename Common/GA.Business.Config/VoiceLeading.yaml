VoiceLeadingPrinciples:
  - Name: Smooth Voice Leading
    Description: Minimize motion in individual voices between chords
    Category: Fundamental
    Principle: Move each voice the smallest possible distance
    Theory: Creates coherent melodic lines and harmonic flow
    Rules:
      - Prefer stepwise motion over leaps
      - Use common tones when possible
      - Avoid large leaps in inner voices
      - Resolve tendency tones properly
    Examples:
      - Progression: C major to F major
        VoiceMovement:
          Soprano: G to A (step up)
          Alto: E to F (step up)
          Tenor: C to C (common tone)
          Bass: C to F (fourth up)
        Analysis: Two common tones, minimal motion
      - Progression: Am to F major
        VoiceMovement:
          Soprano: E to F (step up)
          Alto: C to C (common tone)
          Tenor: A to A (common tone)
          Bass: A to F (third down)

    Practice:
      - Start slow with a metronome (♩=60), then increase by +5 BPM increments.
      - Isolate the core mechanic of Smooth Voice Leading for 2–5 minute loops.
      - Record once per day; review articulation, timing, and noise control.
      - Apply over a ii–V–I in two keys and in one real song this week.
    QualityChecks:
      - Timing within ±10 ms (tap-to-click test).
      - Noise control on adjacent strings (mute plan).
      - Consistent tone across positions/patterns.
      - Playable fingerings at two positions on the neck/keyboard.

  - Name: Contrary Motion
    Description: Voices moving in opposite directions
    Category: Fundamental
    Principle: When one voice ascends, another descends
    Theory: Creates independence between voices and avoids parallel motion
    Benefits:
      - Prevents parallel fifths and octaves
      - Creates melodic interest
      - Maintains harmonic balance
    Examples:
      - Progression: C major to G major
        ContraryMotion: Bass moves C to G (up), soprano moves G to B (up), but alto moves
          E to D (down)
      - Progression: V7 to I resolution
        ContraryMotion: Leading tone rises, seventh falls

        - Isolate the core mechanic of HistoricalDevelopment for 2–5 minute loops.
        - Record once per day; review articulation, timing, and noise control.
        - Apply over a ii–V–I in two keys and in one real song this week.
      Examples:
        - Key: C
          TempoBPM: 90
          Meter: 4/4
          Notes: Apply concept over Cmaj7 | Dm7 G7 | Cmaj7.
        - Key: E
          TempoBPM: 100
          Meter: 4/4
          Notes: Apply concept over E minor vamp or E Mixolydian groove.
      QualityChecks:
        - Timing within ±10 ms (tap-to-click test).
        - Noise control on adjacent strings (mute plan).
        - Consistent tone across positions/patterns.
        - Playable fingerings at two positions on the neck/keyboard.
      Metrics:
        TargetBPM: 120
        CleanReps: 10
        DailyMinutes: 12
  Contemporary:
    - Characteristics: Extended techniques, non-functional harmony
