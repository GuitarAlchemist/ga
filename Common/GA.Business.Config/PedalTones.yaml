      Practice:
        - Start slow with a metronome (♩=60), then increase by +5 BPM increments.
        - Isolate the core mechanic of HistoricalContext for 2–5 minute loops.
        - Record once per day; review articulation, timing, and noise control.
        - Apply over a ii–V–I in two keys and in one real song this week.
      Examples:
        - Key: C
          TempoBPM: 90
          Meter: 4/4
          Notes: Apply concept over Cmaj7 | Dm7 G7 | Cmaj7.
        - Key: E
          TempoBPM: 100
          Meter: 4/4
          Notes: Apply concept over E minor vamp or E Mixolydian groove.
      QualityChecks:
        - Timing within ±10 ms (tap-to-click test).
        - Noise control on adjacent strings (mute plan).
        - Consistent tone across positions/patterns.
        - Playable fingerings at two positions on the neck/keyboard.
      Metrics:
        TargetBPM: 120
        CleanReps: 10
