# Guitar Techniques Configuration
# Defines guitar-specific playing techniques and theoretical concepts
# Conventions:
# - Use concise, copyable drills with BPM ladders.
# - Fret numbers are from the nut; string numbers are 6 (low E) → 1 (high E).
# - "Mechanics" is split by hand and muting details for fast troubleshooting.

GuitarTechniques:
  - Name: "Pitch Axis Theory"
    Description: "Keep a central pitch while the harmony around it changes"
    Category: "Lead Guitar"
    Inventor: "Joe Satriani"
    Difficulty: "Advanced"
    Concept: "Sustain a central note (axis) through modal or functional shifts"
    Theory: "Static melody over moving harmony creates tension/release without altering the axis"
    Mechanics:
      PickingHand: "Sustain/ornament axis note; ghost-pick for time feel"
      FrettingHand: "Hold/return to axis, outline chord/harmony tones around it"
      Muting: "RH palm lightly touching adjacent strings; LH finger flats for sympathetic control"
    Examples:
      - CentralPitch: "E"
        ContextHarmony: [ "Em7", "E", "Esus4", "E7", "Emaj7", "Cmaj7/E", "D/E", "F/E" ]
        SuggestedScales: [ "E Dorian", "E Mixolydian", "E Lydian", "E Altered over E7alt" ]
        AxisRegister: "12th fret, 1st string (E) or 9th fret, 3rd string (E)"
      - CentralPitch: "G"
        ContextHarmony: [ "G", "Gm", "G7", "Gsus4", "Gadd9", "Eb/G", "F/G" ]
        SuggestedScales: [ "G Ionian", "G Dorian", "G Mixolydian", "G Lydian" ]
        AxisRegister: "15th fret, 1st string (G) or 12th fret, 3rd string (G)"
    Applications:
      - "Lead lines that ignore functional shifts while implying them"
      - "Layered loop parts (axis on top, harmony below)"
      - "Film/game ostinati with evolving modes"
    Songs: [ "Surfing with the Alien", "Always with Me, Always with You" ]
