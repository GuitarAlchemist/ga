        - Use drone strings for modal resonance (Dorian, Mixolydian)
        - Target characteristic tones (♭2, ♯4, ♭6) in phrasing
      EarTraining:
        - 'Contrast Ionian vs. Lydian by the #4'
        - Recognize Dorian’s natural 6th in minor context
        - Hear Phrygian’s dark ♭2 motion to tonic
      ModalMixtureTips:
        - Borrow ♭VII from Mixolydian or ♭VI from Aeolian in major contexts
