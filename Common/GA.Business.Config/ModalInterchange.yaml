  - Name: Borrowed Chords from Parallel Minor
    Description: Using chords from the parallel minor key in a major key context
    SourceMode: Natural Minor
    TargetMode: Major
    Theory: Creates darker, more complex harmonic colors in major keys
    CommonBorrowedChords:
      - Chord: bVI
        RomanNumeral: bVI
        InKeyOfC: Ab major
        Function: Subdominant substitute
        VoiceLeading: Smooth voice leading from vi
        Examples:
          - Something - Beatles
          - Creep - Radiohead
        UseCases:
          - Color change without tonic modulation
          - Borrowed iv, bVII, bVI in major for cinematic lift
          - Minor tonic coloration in major (bIII, bVI from parallel minor)

        BassNoteHandling: Prefer stepwise bass into/away from altered chords; pedal tonic

      - 'Borrowed iv: treat as minor subdominant — use minor CAGED for quick voicings'
      - 'bVII and bVI: consider drop-2 shapes on middle strings for smooth voice-leading'
    CommonMistakes:
      - Overusing borrowed chords without functional anchor
      - Clashing melody (major 3 over iv chord)
      - Holding altered tones across return to diatonic harmony
    PracticeDrills:
      - Cycle I→iv→I in all 12 keys with guide-tone lines on strings 3–2
      - Improvise over I→bVII→IV using pentatonic overlays and target notes
    EarTraining:
      - Contrast IV vs iv in major (listen for b3 coloration)
      - Differentiate bVII (Mixolydian color) from V of IV (secondary dominant)

  - Name: Dorian Interchange
    Description: Borrowing the natural 6th degree from Dorian mode
    SourceMode: Dorian
    TargetMode: Natural Minor
    Theory: The raised 6th creates a brighter minor sound
    CharacteristicChords:
      - Chord: IV
        RomanNumeral: IV
        InKeyOfAm: D major
        Function: Major subdominant in minor
        Effect: Dorian brightness
        Examples:
          - Scarborough Fair
          - Eleanor Rigby - Beatles
        UseCases:
          - Color change without tonic modulation
          - Borrowed iv, bVII, bVI in major for cinematic lift
          - Minor tonic coloration in major (bIII, bVI from parallel minor)
        VoiceLeading:
          Approach: Preserve common tones; move altered degrees in semitone steps where
            possible
          Tips:
            - Resolve b6→5 or ♭7→1 smoothly in the melody
            - Avoid parallel fifths when moving between borrowed and diatonic chords

        - Smooth strumming through modal progressions
      UseCases:
        - Color change without tonic modulation
        - Borrowed iv, bVII, bVI in major for cinematic lift
        - Minor tonic coloration in major (bIII, bVI from parallel minor)
      VoiceLeading:
        Approach: Preserve common tones; move altered degrees in semitone steps where
          possible
        Tips:
          - Resolve b6→5 or ♭7→1 smoothly in the melody
          - Avoid parallel fifths when moving between borrowed and diatonic chords

      ProgressionRecipes:
        - I → bVII → IV → I
        - I → iv → I
        - I → bVI → bVII → I
        - i → bVII → bVI → V (Aeolian color to V cadence)
      BassNoteHandling: Prefer stepwise bass into/away from altered chords; pedal tonic
        works well for quick colors
      MelodicConsiderations: Emphasize altered scale degrees (b3, b6, b7 in major) only
        when the harmony supports them
      GuitarFretboardTips:
        - 'Borrowed iv: treat as minor subdominant — use minor CAGED for quick voicings'
        - 'bVII and bVI: consider drop-2 shapes on middle strings for smooth voice-leading'
      CommonMistakes:
        - Overusing borrowed chords without functional anchor
        - Clashing melody (major 3 over iv chord)
        - Holding altered tones across return to diatonic harmony
      PracticeDrills:
        - Cycle I→iv→I in all 12 keys with guide-tone lines on strings 3–2
        - Improvise over I→bVII→IV using pentatonic overlays and target notes
      EarTraining:
        - Contrast IV vs iv in major (listen for b3 coloration)
        - Differentiate bVII (Mixolydian color) from V of IV (secondary dominant)

AnalysisApproach:
  IdentificationSteps: 1. "Identify the primary key/mode" 2. "Locate chords that don't
    belong to that key" 3. "Determine the source mode of borrowed chords" 4. "Analyze
    the voice leading and harmonic function" 5. "Assess the emotional/dramatic effect"
  NotationConventions:
    - Use Roman numerals with accidentals (bVI, bVII)
    - Indicate source mode in analysis
    - Show voice leading with arrows or lines
  CommonMistakes:
    - Confusing modal interchange with modulation
    - Ignoring voice leading principles
    - Overusing borrowed chords without musical purpose
