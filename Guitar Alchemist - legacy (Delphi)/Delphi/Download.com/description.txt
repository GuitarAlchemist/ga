Play common scales/modes directly on the staff or the fingerboard, and find matching chords.
Play chords in the voicing you want (Inversions, difficulty, and many other features) and find the scales you can play over it.
Play the notes directly on the fingerboard (lefties too!) or on the staff.
More than a chord dictionnay, Guitar Alchemist really makes the link between chords, scales, and notes.
