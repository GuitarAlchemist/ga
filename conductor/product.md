# Product Definition

## Vision
Guitar Alchemist is an advanced, AI-driven music education platform that bridges the gap between theoretical knowledge and physical instrument proficiency. It uses cutting-edge AI (Semantic Kernel, LLMs, Computer Vision) to provide a "smart" learning environment.

## Key Capabilities

### 1. Intelligent Music Theory Engine
- **Core Logic:** Comprehensive modeling of Notes, Intervals, Scales, Modes (Major, Harmonic/Melodic Minor), and Keys.
- **Atonal Theory:** Support for Pitch Class Sets and post-tonal analysis.
- **Instrument Agnostic:** Supports Guitar, Bass, Banjo, Ukulele, and custom stringed instruments.

### 2. Interactive Learning Environment
- **Fretboard Visualization:** Real-time rendering of scale patterns and chord voicings.
- **Hand Pose Detection:** Uses computer vision to analyze user hand positioning (via webcam) for technique feedback.
- **3D Visualization:** "BSP Dungeon" metaphor for exploring musical structures (FloorManager).

### 3. AI Assistant
- **Chatbot:** Context-aware music tutor built on Microsoft Semantic Kernel.
- **Semantic Search:** Find chords based on "mood" (happy, dreamy, tense) rather than just names.
- **Generative Audio:** AI-synthesized sound samples for practice backing tracks.

### 4. Semantic Voicing System
The platform tags musical structures with rich metadata:
- **Emotions:** `sad`, `dreamy`, `aggressive`.
- **Genres:** `neo-soul`, `flamenco`, `jazz-comping`.
- **Techniques:** `shell-voicing`, `drop-2`, `quartal-harmony`.
- **Famous Sounds:** `hendrix-chord`, `james-bond-chord`.

## User Personas
- **The Student:** Wants visual feedback on scales and chords.
- **The Composer:** Needs "mood-based" chord suggestions.
- **The Theory Nerd:** Explores pitch class sets and complex harmonic relationships.
